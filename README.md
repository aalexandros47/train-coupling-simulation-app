# Train Coupling Simulation

University project demonstrating dynamic train coupling & decoupling simulation for efficient railway operations

## Overview

This web application simulates dynamic train coupling and decoupling, demonstrating how two trains adjust their speeds and distances to either link together or operate independently. Coupling allows trains to operate more efficiently by moving as a single unit, while decoupling provides flexibility and improved utilization of railway infrastructure.

## Features

- Dynamic simulation of train coupling and decoupling.
- Real-time display of train speeds.
- Smooth animation and visual representation using HTML canvas.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with custom styling and gradient backgrounds)
- JavaScript (for dynamic behavior and animation)
- Google Fonts (Roboto font family)

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
